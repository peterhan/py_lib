whats better than hive original
according to org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/tools/LineageInfo.java
 * This class prints out the lineage info. It takes sql as input and prints
 * lineage info. Currently this prints only input and output tables for a given
 * sql. Later we can expand to add join tables etc.
 
scan_hql_script 
[could get map join table]
and could find add jar and add function's java class info,
could support new syntax more easy,hackable.
